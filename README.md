## Youtube Word Search
An extension that lets you search for words in a youtube video, and seeks to that timestamp

## How it will work
- Once you go on a youtube video, I will need to have a transcript of the video
- Using some shortcut, will open a search bar somewhere around the video where you can search for words
- As you write a word, it will show you the number of times it appears in the video(transcript)
- As you press enter, the video will seek to the timestamp

## Todo
- <s>Determine when you're on a video</s>
- <s>Get transcript of video given the video ID</s>
- <s>Write a function that will given a word and transcript get a list of timestamps</s>
- <s>Write a function that will seek a youtube video to a timestamp</s>
- Searchbar + enter + shortcut logic

## Possible Pull Requests
- Remove preposition words from the mapping (words like "of", "as", "on")
